Walk me through your information-gathering approach.,"I'll walk you through a systematic approach to plan a budget-friendly vacation. Let me break this down into key information-gathering steps:

## 1. Define Your Parameters First

- **Look at package deals** on sites like Costco Travel, which sometimes beat piecing together components
- **Explore lesser-known alternatives** to popular destinations (e.g., Ljubljana instead of Prague)

## 3. Transportation Deep-Dive
**Information sources:**
- **Flight aggregators:** Google Flights, Skyscanner, Momondo
- **Alternative transport:** Megabus, Amtrak, BlaBlaCar for shorter distances

## 4. Accommodation Investigation
**My research strategy:**
- **Compare platforms:** Booking.com, Airbnb, Hostelworld, even Facebook Marketplace
- **Consider alternatives:** House-sitting, home exchanges, camping

- **Read recent reviews** for budget options (quality can vary significantly)

## 5. Daily Cost Reality Check
**Gather intel on:**
