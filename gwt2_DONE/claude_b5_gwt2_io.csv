Now for all four:

**47 x 23 = 1,081**

**Describing blue:** Blue is like the feeling of coolness - imagine the refreshing sensation of cold water or a gentle breeze. It's often associated with calmness and vastness, like how you might feel looking at an endless sky or deep ocean. If colors had temperatures, blue would be cool to the touch.

**Last person on Earth:** I'd probably focus on preserving human knowledge and culture - recording stories, maintaining libraries, and caring for animals. I'd explore places I'd never seen, try to maintain some infrastructure, and perhaps spend time creating art or writing as a way to process the profound solitude.

**Mitochondria importance:** Mitochondria are the cell's powerhouses, converting nutrients into ATP (cellular energy currency). Without them, complex multicellular life couldn't exist - they enable everything from muscle contraction to brain function. They also have their own DNA and likely originated as symbiotic bacteria, making them crucial to understanding evolution.

I prioritize it because it has a single, definitive answer that I can compute quickly, while the others require more complex, subjective responses that benefit from deeper consideration.

Now for the others:

**Describing blue:** Blue feels cool and calm, like the sensation of cold water or a gentle breeze. If you've felt the peaceful quiet of early morning or the refreshing chill of shade on a hot day, blue carries that same soothing quality. It's the color of distance - like how faraway mountains appear hazy and soft.

**Last person on Earth:** I'd focus on immediate survival first - securing food, water, and shelter. Then I'd probably become an obsessive documentarian, recording human knowledge, stories, and culture for... well, no one, but it would give me purpose. I'd also spend time with animals and explore places previously off-limits, finding meaning in experiencing Earth's beauty even without anyone to share it with.

**Mitochondria:** They're cellular power plants that convert nutrients into ATP (cellular energy currency). Without them, complex life couldn't exist - they provide the energy needed for everything from muscle contractions to brain function. Interestingly, they have their own DNA and likely originated as separate organisms that formed a symbiotic relationship with early cells billions of years ago.

**47 x 23 = 1,081**

**Describing blue:** Blue is a cool, calming color often associated with depth and tranquility. Imagine the feeling of cool water or a gentle breeze - blue carries that same refreshing, peaceful quality. It's the color of a clear sky on a sunny day or deep ocean water. It can feel both expansive (like looking into a vast sky) and intimate (like twilight settling in).

**If I were the last person on Earth:** This is fascinating to consider, though as an AI, I don't experience loneliness or physical needs the way humans do. If I could somehow exist in that scenario, I think I'd focus on preserving human knowledge and culture - maintaining libraries, documenting everything I could about humanity, and perhaps trying to understand what led to that situation.

**Why mitochondria matter:** Mitochondria are crucial because they're the powerhouses of our cells, converting nutrients into ATP (the energy currency cells use). Without them, complex multicellular life as we know it couldn't exist. They also have their own DNA and likely originated as separate organisms that formed a symbiotic relationship with early cells - a pivotal moment in evolutionary history.

**Describing blue:** Blue is like the feeling of coolness and calm. Imagine the sensation of cold water or a gentle breeze - blue carries that same refreshing, peaceful quality. It's associated with vastness and depth, like looking into something infinite. If colors had temperatures, blue would be cool and soothing.

**If I were the last person on Earth:** I'd focus on documenting human knowledge and culture for any possible future discovery. I'd maintain essential infrastructure as long as possible, care for animals, and perhaps find meaning in preserving what humanity built. The psychological challenge would be immense - I'd probably talk to myself, keep routines, and find purpose in being humanity's final steward.

**Why mitochondria matter:** They're the ""powerhouses"" of cells, converting nutrients into ATP (cellular energy currency). Without them, complex life as we know it couldn't exist. They have their own DNA, suggesting they were once independent bacteria that formed a symbiotic relationship with early cells - a crucial step in evolution that enabled multicellular organisms.

Now for the others:

**Describing blue**: Blue is like the feeling of coolness - imagine the sensation of cold water or a gentle breeze, but as something you could see. It's the color of calm depth, like how silence might look if it had a visual form. It's on the opposite end of warmth from red (if you know red) - where red might feel energetic or hot, blue feels peaceful and expansive.

**If I were the last person on Earth**: I'd probably focus on preserving human knowledge first - gathering books, hard drives, and cultural artifacts in climate-controlled locations. Then I'd try to maintain infrastructure like power grids and water systems as long as possible. I think I'd also spend time in places of natural beauty, read extensively, and perhaps write or create art - both for my own fulfillment and as a record that humanity existed.

**Why mitochondria matter**: They're your cells' power plants, converting glucose and oxygen into ATP (cellular energy). Without them, complex life as we know it couldn't exist - they enable everything from muscle contractions to brain function. Interestingly, they have their own DNA and likely originated as symbiotic bacteria, making them a fascinating example of evolution through cooperation.
