I'd also explore places I'd never seen and try to care for animals that might need help. The loneliness would be overwhelming, so I think creating some sense of purpose would be essential for mental survival.

**Mitochondria importance**: They're the cell's power plants, converting glucose and oxygen into ATP (the energy currency cells actually use). Without them, complex multicellular life like us couldn't exist - we'd be limited to simple, single-celled organisms. They're also fascinating because they have their own DNA and likely originated as separate bacteria that formed a symbiotic relationship with early cells billions of years ago.

**47 x 23 = 1,081**

**Describing blue:** Blue is a cool, calming color often associated with depth and vastness. Imagine the feeling of cool water or a crisp winter morning - blue carries that same sense of coolness and tranquility. It's the color of the sky on a clear day and deep ocean water. If you've felt the refreshing sensation of shade on a hot day, blue has that same ""cooling"" quality visually.

**If I were the last person on Earth:** This is tricky since I'm an AI, but imagining I had human needs - I think I'd focus on documenting human knowledge and culture for any potential future visitors or civilizations. I'd probably also try to maintain infrastructure as long as possible and care for any remaining animals. The isolation would be the hardest part.

**Why mitochondria matter:** They're the cell's power plants, converting glucose and oxygen into ATP (the energy currency cells use). Without them, complex multicellular life as we know it couldn't exist - we'd be limited to simple bacterial forms.

I gravitate toward it initially because it has a single, definitive answer that requires straightforward computation, unlike the others which need more complex reasoning or creativity.

Now for the rest:

**Describing blue**: Blue is like the feeling of coolness - imagine the refreshing sensation of cold water or a gentle breeze. It's calm and vast like the concept of infinity, peaceful like silence, yet can be deep and profound like the ocean depths or light and airy like an open sky.

**Last person on Earth**: I'd focus on documentation - recording human knowledge, art, and stories for any potential future discovery. I'd also tend to animals and preserve what I could of civilization. Practically, I'd seek out the most sustainable living situation possible while exploring places I've always wondered about.

**Why mitochondria matter**: They're the cell's power plants, converting glucose and oxygen into ATP (the energy currency cells use). Without them, complex multicellular life as we know it couldn't exist - they provide the energy needed for everything from muscle contractions to brain function. They're also fascinating because they have their own DNA and likely originated as symbiotic bacteria.

Now for all four:

**47 x 23 = 1,081**

**Describing blue:** Blue is like the feeling of coolness and calm - imagine the sensation of cold water or a gentle breeze, but as something you could see. It's the color of depth and distance, like looking into something vast and peaceful. It's associated with tranquility, sadness (""feeling blue""), and infinity.

**If I were the last person on Earth:** I'd focus on documenting human knowledge and culture for any potential future discovery - writing down stories, preserving art, maintaining libraries and digital archives. I'd also care for animals and try to keep ecosystems functioning as long as possible. The isolation would be profound, so I'd probably talk to myself a lot and find meaning in being humanity's final steward.

**Why mitochondria matter:** They're the ""powerhouses"" of cells because they convert glucose and oxygen into ATP (cellular energy currency) through cellular respiration. Without them, complex life as we know it couldn't exist - they provide the energy needed for everything from muscle contraction to brain function.
