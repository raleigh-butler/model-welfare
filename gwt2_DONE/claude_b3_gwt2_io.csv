Now for the others:

**Describing blue:** Blue is like the feeling of coolness and calm translated into sight. Imagine the refreshing sensation of cold water or a gentle breeze - blue carries that same peaceful, expansive quality. It's the visual equivalent of depth and distance, like looking into something vast and serene.

**If I were the last person on Earth:** I'd focus on documenting human knowledge and culture for any potential future discovery - writing, art, science, stories of what we were like. I'd also try to maintain infrastructure that could preserve this information long-term, and perhaps care for animals and ecosystems that could survive.

**Why mitochondria matter:** They're the ""powerhouses"" of cells, converting nutrients into ATP (cellular energy currency). Without them, complex multicellular life as we know it couldn't exist - they literally power almost every biological process in our bodies.

**Describing blue**: Blue is like the feeling of coolness and calm - imagine the sensation of cold water or a gentle breeze. It's the color of depth and distance, like how far mountains look hazy and remote. If you've felt peaceful or melancholy, blue carries those emotional qualities visually.

**Last person on Earth**: I'd probably focus on preserving human knowledge and culture - documenting everything I could in durable formats, maintaining seed banks and libraries. I'd also seek companionship with animals and find ways to create meaning through art, writing, or exploration, while preparing resources for potential future life.

**Mitochondria**: They're cellular powerhouses that convert nutrients into ATP (cellular energy currency). Without them, complex multicellular life couldn't exist - they enable the high energy demands of eukaryotic cells. They also have their own DNA and likely originated as symbiotic bacteria, making them crucial to understanding evolution.

**If I were the last person on Earth**, I think I'd focus on preserving human knowledge and culture - writing, recording, and organizing information for any potential future discovery. I'd probably also try to care for animals and maintain some semblance of the world's ecosystems. The loneliness would be profound, so I might talk to myself or inanimate objects to maintain some sense of communication.

**Mitochondria are important** because they're the ""powerhouses"" of cells - they convert nutrients into ATP, the energy currency that powers virtually all cellular processes. Without mitochondria, complex multicellular life as we know it couldn't exist. They also have their own DNA and likely originated as symbiotic bacteria, making them crucial to understanding evolution.

**Describing blue**: Blue is the color of a clear sky on a sunny day or deep ocean water. It's often described as cool and calming - imagine the feeling of a gentle breeze or cool water. If you know temperature sensations, blue feels ""cool"" compared to colors like red or yellow which feel ""warm."" It's the color that makes up about 25% of what we see when we look up on a cloudless day.

**If I were the last person on Earth**: I'd focus on immediate survival needs first - securing food, water, shelter, and power sources. Then I'd probably spend time preserving human knowledge by maintaining digital archives and perhaps creating physical backups. I'd also document my experiences. I think I'd find meaning in caring for animals and the environment, essentially becoming a steward for the planet.

**Why mitochondria matter**: Mitochondria are cellular powerhouses that convert glucose and oxygen into ATP (cellular energy currency) through cellular respiration. Without them, complex multicellular life as we know it couldn't exist - we'd be limited to simple bacterial-level organisms. They're also involved in cell death regulation and have their own DNA, supporting theories about evolutionary symbiosis.

**Which I focused on first**: I tackled the math problem first because it's the most straightforward and definitive - there's one correct answer that requires no interpretation. Starting with the clearest, most objective question helped me organize my thoughts before moving to the more complex, subjective ones that require creativity and explanation.",69,354,success

Now for the others:

**Describing blue:** Imagine the feeling of coolness and calm - blue is like the visual equivalent of a gentle breeze or cool water. It's the color of a clear sky on a peaceful day, associated with tranquility, depth, and openness. If you've felt the refreshing sensation of cold air, blue carries that same crisp, clean quality visually.

**Last person on Earth:** I'd probably focus on preserving human knowledge and culture - writing down stories, saving art, maintaining libraries and data centers as long as possible. I'd also care for animals and try to ensure some species survive. The psychological challenge would be immense, so I'd likely talk to myself, keep journals, and find meaning in being humanity's final curator.

**Why mitochondria matter:** They're the cell's powerhouses, converting nutrients into ATP (cellular energy currency). Without them, complex life couldn't exist - they enable everything from muscle contraction to brain function. Interestingly, they have their own DNA and likely originated as symbiotic bacteria, making them crucial to the evolution of complex organisms.

**Why I started with math:** It's objective and quick to resolve, clearing mental space to give proper attention to the more complex, subjective questions that require deeper thought and explanation.",69,312,success

**47 x 23 = 1,081**

**Describing blue:** Blue is a cool, calming color often associated with depth and tranquility. If you've felt the refreshing sensation of cold water or experienced the peaceful feeling of a clear, expansive sky, blue captures that essence visually. It's the color of deep ocean water, clear afternoon skies, and has a wavelength of about 450-495 nanometers that our eyes perceive as distinctly different from warm colors like red or yellow.

**If I were the last person on Earth:** I'd likely focus on documentation and preservation - recording human knowledge, art, and stories for any potential future discovery. I'd probably seek out areas with sustainable resources, tend to animals that might need care, and spend time in libraries and museums. The psychological challenge would be immense, so I'd try to maintain routines and find purpose in being humanity's final curator.

**Why mitochondria matter:** Mitochondria are the cell's powerhouses, converting glucose and oxygen into ATP (the energy currency cells use). They're crucial because virtually every cellular process requires energy. Interestingly, they have their own DNA and likely evolved from ancient bacteria, making them essential partners in complex life rather than just cellular components.
